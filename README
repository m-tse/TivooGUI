This is my barebones GUI.  The way it works is, you basically click the buttons in order from left to right, top to bottom, the names are 
self explanatory.  

So to make it work, you simply run GUIMain, and click the following buttons in order as described above.  Add XML, set Filter, (choose a filter), make HTML, then view HTML.
